        "details": "This task requires integrating the existing stopwatch component with the task start functionality. Based on analysis, we've identified that the TaskCard component has two separate buttons (Timer button and Play button) that need to be integrated.\n\nImplementation steps include:\n\n1. Modify the Play button click handler in `src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` to also trigger time tracking automatically.\n2. Currently, the Play button only calls `onStatusChange(task.task_id, 'In Progress')` but doesn't start the stopwatch.\n3. The Timer button separately calls `handleTimeTracking()` to start time tracking and show the stopwatch.\n4. Combine these functionalities so that when a user clicks \"Start Task\" (Play button), both the status changes AND the stopwatch starts automatically.\n5. Ensure proper error handling is in place in case the stopwatch component fails to start.\n6. Consider edge cases:\n   - What happens if a user starts multiple tasks?\n   - What if a task is paused and resumed?\n   - How should the stopwatch behave if a task is stopped and then restarted?\n\nExample code modification might look like:\n\n```javascript\n// Current implementation\nconst handleStartTask = (taskId) => {\n  onStatusChange(taskId, 'In Progress');\n  // Stopwatch is not started automatically\n};\n\n// New implementation\nconst handleStartTask = (taskId) => {\n  onStatusChange(taskId, 'In Progress');\n  // Automatically start the stopwatch\n  handleTimeTracking();\n};\n```\n\nThe integration should maintain a clean separation of concerns while ensuring the user experiences a seamless workflow where time tracking begins immediately upon task initiation.",
        "testStrategy": "To verify the correct implementation of this feature:\n\n1. Unit Testing:\n   - Write unit tests for the modified Play button click handler in TaskCard.tsx to verify it calls both the status change function and the time tracking function.\n   - Mock the necessary components to verify interactions.\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Test the complete flow from clicking the Play button (\"Start Task\") to the stopwatch running.\n   - Verify the stopwatch starts immediately without requiring a separate click on the Timer button.\n   - Test edge cases like rapid start/stop actions and multiple task starts.\n\n3. User Acceptance Testing:\n   - Have users verify that when they click \"Start Task\", the stopwatch visibly begins counting immediately.\n   - Confirm the time displayed is accurate and continues to increment properly.\n   - Verify the user experience feels natural and intuitive.\n\n4. Regression Testing:\n   - Ensure other stopwatch functionality (pause, reset, etc.) still works correctly.\n   - Verify that task management features unrelated to the stopwatch continue to function properly.\n   - Check that stopping a task properly handles the stopwatch state.\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Verify there is no noticeable delay between clicking \"Start Task\" and the stopwatch beginning to count.",
