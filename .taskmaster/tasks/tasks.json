Create src/hooks/useAiMotivation.ts wrapping AiService.generateMotivationAiMotivationPost() for AI-powered motivation generation. Build demo components in src/pages/ showcasing all functionality: ProgressLogPage.tsx for progress tracking and statistics, AiMotivationPage.tsx for motivation features.
