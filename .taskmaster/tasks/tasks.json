        "title": "Integrate Redux Toolkit for Centralized State Management",
        "description": "Implement Redux Toolkit to replace scattered state management patterns with a centralized store, improving predictability, debugging capabilities, and performance.",
        "details": "## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Setup and Configuration**\n   - Install required dependencies: `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux redux-persist redux-logger`\n   - Create a store configuration file at `src/store/index.ts`\n   - Configure Redux DevTools integration for development environments\n   - Set up Redux Provider in the application root component\n\n2. **Store Structure Implementation**\n   - Create a modular store structure with the following slices:\n     - `src/store/slices/appConfigSlice.ts` - App configuration (migrated from AppContext)\n     - `src/store/slices/dialogSlice.ts` - Dialog states management\n     - `src/store/slices/uiSlice.ts` - UI states (toasts, loading indicators)\n     - `src/store/slices/optimisticUpdatesSlice.ts` - Optimistic updates for tasks\n     - `src/store/slices/formSlice.ts` - Form states and validation errors\n     - `src/store/slices/navigationSlice.ts` - Navigation and routing state\n\n3. **TypeScript Type Definitions**\n   - Create `src/store/types.ts` with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:\n     - RootState type\n     - Each slice's state interface\n     - Action payload types\n     - Selector return types\n\n4. **Middleware Configuration**\n   - Implement Redux middleware for side effects:\n     - Configure Redux Thunk for async operations\n     - Set up custom middleware for logging (in development)\n     - Add persistence middleware for relevant state slices\n\n5. **Migration Strategy**\n   - Implement each slice individually, starting with:\n     - AppConfig slice to replace AppContext\n     - Dialog slice to replace DialogStateManager\n     - UI slice for toast notifications\n   - Create custom hooks in `src/hooks/redux/` to simplify component access:\n     - `useAppConfig.ts`\n     - `useDialogs.ts`\n     - `useToasts.ts`\n     - etc.\n\n6. **Component Updates**\n   - Systematically update components to use Redux:\n     - Replace `useContext(AppContext)` with custom Redux hooks\n     - Update components using DialogStateManager\n     - Migrate toast notification components\n     - Replace optimistic updates implementation\n   - Use `useSelector` for state access and `useDispatch` for actions\n\n7. **Performance Optimizations**\n   - Implement memoized selectors using `createSelector`\n   - Add shallowEqual comparison where appropriate\n   - Use `useSelector` with specific state slices to prevent unnecessary re-renders\n\n8. **Testing Infrastructure**\n   - Create test utilities in `src/tests/redux/`\n   - Implement mock store configuration for testing\n   - Add helper functions for testing selectors and reducers\n\n9. **Documentation**\n   - Create comprehensive documentation in `docs/state-management.md`\n   - Document each slice's purpose, state structure, and available actions\n   - Add usage examples for common patterns\n   - Include migration guide for developers\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- Ensure backward compatibility during migration by maintaining both systems temporarily\n- Use RTK's `createSlice` for all reducers to leverage simplified action creators\n- Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout the Redux implementation\n- Consider using Redux Toolkit's `createEntityAdapter` for collections of items\n- Use the Redux DevTools Extension for debugging during development\n- Consider implementing a feature flag system to gradually roll out Redux integration",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Unit Testing**\n   - Write comprehensive unit tests for each Redux slice:\n     - Test initial state configuration\n     - Test all reducer functions with various action payloads\n     - Test selectors for correct state extraction\n     - Test action creators for proper payload formatting\n   - Use Jest and React Testing Library for all tests\n   - Example test command: `npm run test:redux`\n\n2. **Integration Testing**\n   - Test the integration between Redux and React components:\n     - Verify components correctly dispatch actions\n     - Ensure components re-render appropriately when state changes\n     - Test that connected components receive the right props\n   - Create test fixtures with predefined state for consistent testing\n   - Test middleware functionality with mock API responses\n\n3. **Migration Verification**\n   - Create a checklist of all state management patterns to migrate\n   - Implement verification tests that ensure:\n     - AppContext functionality is fully replicated in Redux\n     - DialogStateManager behavior is preserved\n     - Toast notifications work identically\n     - Optimistic updates function correctly\n   - Run both systems in parallel with comparison tests during migration\n\n4. **Performance Testing**\n   - Measure render performance before and after Redux implementation\n   - Use React DevTools Profiler to compare component render counts\n   - Test with large state objects to ensure performance at scale\n   - Verify memoized selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders\n\n5. **Redux DevTools Verification**\n   - Manually verify that Redux DevTools correctly displays:\n     - All state changes\n     - Action history\n     - Time-travel debugging functionality\n     - State structure as designed\n\n6. **Cross-browser Testing**\n   - Test Redux implementation across major browsers\n   - Verify persistence works correctly across browser sessions\n   - Test performance in different browser environments\n\n7. **Documentation Testing**\n   - Review documentation for completeness and accuracy\n   - Have team members follow documentation to implement new features\n   - Verify all examples in documentation work as expected\n\n8. **Acceptance Criteria**\n   - All existing functionality works identically after migration\n   - Redux DevTools shows complete state tree with proper organization\n   - No regressions in user experience or application behavior\n   - Performance metrics show improvement or no degradation\n   - All tests pass with 90%+ coverage of Redux code",
