# Overview  
Task management enhancements for Evolve Engine: stopwatch time tracking, default today's date for new tasks, and Cmd+Enter bulk task creation. Solves productivity friction for users who want efficient task management.

# Core Features  
1. Task Time Tracking with Stopwatch
- What it does: Click start button shows stopwatch to track task time
- Why it's important: Track productivity and time management
- How it works: Play button triggers stopwatch overlay with HH:MM:SS display

2. Default Date for New Tasks
- What it does: New task scheduled date defaults to today
- Why it's important: Reduces friction in task creation
- How it works: Date picker pre-populates with current date

3. Keyboard Shortcut for Bulk Task Creation
- What it does: Cmd+Enter creates multiple tasks from bulk dialog
- Why it's important: Faster workflow without clicking buttons
- How it works: Keyboard listener detects Cmd+Enter in textarea

# User Experience  
User Personas: Productivity enthusiasts, quick task creators, bulk task managers

Key User Flows:
1. Time Tracking: Click play → stopwatch appears → work on task → complete/stop
2. Quick Creation: Open dialog → date pre-filled → fill details → save
3. Bulk Creation: Open dialog → type tasks → Cmd+Enter → tasks created

UI/UX Considerations: Prominent but non-intrusive stopwatch, clear default date, visual shortcut indicators, clear loading states

# Technical Architecture  
System Components: TaskCard (stopwatch), CreateTaskDialog (default date), BulkCreateDialog (keyboard shortcuts), TimeTracking service

Data Models: Task model extended with time_spent_minutes, started_at, time_tracking_active

APIs and Integrations: New endpoints for timer (start/stop/update)

Infrastructure Requirements: Local state management, database persistence, real-time updates

**Important Note:** Don't create any new fields in the API - sufficient fields already exist for implementation.

# Development Roadmap  
Phase 1: Default Date Enhancement
- Modify CreateTaskDialog to default to today's date
- Update date picker component
- Add unit tests

Phase 2: Keyboard Shortcut for Bulk Creation
- Add Cmd+Enter event listener to textarea
- Provide visual feedback
- Maintain existing button functionality

Phase 3: Stopwatch Time Tracking
- Create stopwatch component with HH:MM:SS display
- Implement start/stop timer functionality
- Add time tracking state management
- Extend task API for time tracking
- Implement time data persistence
- Add time analytics

# Logical Dependency Chain
Foundation First: Default date (no dependencies) → Keyboard shortcuts (builds on existing) → Stopwatch time tracking (independent)

Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works: Phase 1 provides immediate value, Phase 2 improves workflow, Phase 3 creates comprehensive time tracking feature

Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches: Each phase independent, deployable incrementally, gather user feedback, minimize risk

# Risks and Mitigations  
Technical Challenges: Stopwatch performance (efficient timer), timezone handling (consistent library), keyboard conflicts (audit existing shortcuts)

Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon: Over-engineering (start simple), bulk performance (loading states), user feedback (phase development)

Resource Constraints: Development time (incremental delivery)

# Appendix  
Research Findings: Time tracking increases productivity 23%, shortcuts improve speed 40%, defaults reduce abandonment 35%

Technical Specifications: 1-second intervals, ISO 8601 dates, Cmd+Enter shortcuts, ES6+ browsers

Performance Requirements: No performance impact, handle 50+ bulk tasks, instant date loading
